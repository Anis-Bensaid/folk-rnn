# Folk music style modelling using LSTMs

This is the data we have used.

1. sessions_data_clean.txt: This comes from the [weekly repository of thesession.org](https://github.com/adactio/TheSession-data), except we have cleaned it to a very thorough degree (removing html, comments, etc.).

2. allabcwrepeats_parsed: This is the above but cleaned, and tokenised.

3. allabcworepeats_parsed: This is the above but with the repeats made explicit (converting to midi and back to abc)
