# Folk music style modelling using LSTMs

This code was used for the following published works:

1. Sturm, Santos and Korshunova, ["Folk Music Style Modelling by Recurrent Neural Networks with Long Short Term Memory Units"](http://ismir2015.uma.es/LBD/LBD13.pdf), Late-breaking demo at the 2015 Int. Symposium on Music Information Retrieval

2. Sturm, Santos, Ben-Tal and Korshunova, "Music transcription modelling and composition using deep learning", in Proc. [1st Conf. Computer Simulation of Musical Creativity](https://csmc2016.wordpress.com), Huddersfield, UK, July 2016.

3. Sturm and Ben-Tal, Bringing the models back to music practice: The evaluation of deep learning approaches to music transcription modelling and generation,‚Äù J. Creative Music Systems, 2016 (in press).

This code was also used to create the following music compositions:

1. "Bastard Tunes" by Oded Ben-Tal (2017)
2. "Chicken Bits and Bits and Bobs" by Bob L. Sturm (2017)
3. "March to the Mainframe" by Bob L. Sturm (2017)
4. "Interlude" by Bob L. Sturm (2017)
5. "The Humours of Time Pigeon" by Bob L. Sturm (2017)
6. "It came out from a pretrained net" by Bob L. Sturm (2016) (https://highnoongmt.wordpress.com/2015/12/16/tis-the-season-for-some-deep-carols/)
